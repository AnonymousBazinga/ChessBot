Welcome to StonkFish, our computer project chess engine
Here are some points to help you use this program.

1. The user always plays as black

2. Moves are made upon clicking 2 buttons - 
the piece you want to move (1) and the position you wish to move it to (2)

3. If an illegal move is made, the computer disallows it 
and the user must enter the move again

4. In the variant, note that the black pieces can be placed anywhere in the bottom 2 rows
 and the white pieces in the top 2 rows
