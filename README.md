## Background
This is my senior year CS project, where I built a chess engine that is capable of playing at ~1100 ELO (chess.com).

We also created a chess variant to play against the bot, where there are no pawns and the white and black pieces can be places anywhere in the first and last two ranks respectively.

I worked with Tarun and Vignesh on this project. All credit goes to them for the tkinter user interface.

## Issues
1. Due to some bugs in the tkinter library, the colours and design of the GUI/ chess board does not show up properly on a mac computer.
2. En Passent cannot be played.
3. Pawn auto-promotes to a queen when it reaches the 8th rank.
4. The code is not formatted well. Since this was the first big project we took on, a lot of learning happened along the way inevitably destroying the formatting and code quality. I apologize in advance
