## Background
This is my senior year CS project, where I built a chess engine that is capable of playing at ~1100 ELO (chess.com). We also created a chess variant to play against the bot, where there are no pawns and the white and black pieces can be places anywhere in the first and last two ranks respectively.
I worked with Tarun and Vignesh on this project.

## Execution

Here are some pointers to help you use this program.
1. The user always plays as black
2. Moves are made upon clicking 2 buttons - 
the piece you want to move (1) and the position you wish to move it to (2)
3. If an illegal move is made, the computer disallows it 
and the user must enter a new, legal move again
4. In the variant, note that the black pieces can be placed anywhere in the bottom 2 rows
 and the white pieces in the top 2 rows

**NOTE**: Due to some bugs in the tkinter library, the colours and design of the GUI/ chess board does not show up properly on a mac computer.
