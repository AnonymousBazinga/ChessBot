# ChessBot
This is my senior year CS project, where I built a chess engine that is capable of playing at ~1100 ELO (chess.com). We also created a chess variant to play against the bot, where there are no pawns and the white and black pieces can be places anywhere in the first and last two ranks respectively.
I worked with Tarun and Vignesh on this project.
